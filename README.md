## Team: 
1. Srikeerthana Reddy Bandi (sribandi)

## Project Summary:
We want to provide an all-inclusive platform for all aspects of the housing market, making it convenient and more accessible for people looking to lease houses or apartments. The application will cater to two types of users, namely admins and generic users. The application will streamline the apartment management process for the admin. Using this platform, the admin can manage apartment-related information from anywhere, while generic users can search for apartments and check their availability without the need to visit multiple sites or contact different agents. They can do it all from the comfort of their own homes, making the process hassle-free.

## Project Description:
### Objectives: 
1.	To provide a platform for admin to manage apartments efficiently by performing CRUD operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting the apartment data.
2.	To allow users to search for apartments based on their preferences such as location, number of rooms, amenities, and price range.
3.	To show the availability count of each house type.
4.	To provide an intuitive user interface for both the admin and users to interact with the application. 

## Technical Description: 
We have utilized the MVC (Model View Controller) architecture for building the entire application, with PHP as the server-side scripting language.

### Model:
We are using MySQL relational database management system for storing our data.

### View:
We are using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap framework), and JavaScript to create and customize web pages.

### Controller:
We are using PHP for the backend to perform all the CRUD operations.

### Data:
We compiled our own dataset by gathering information from various housing management websites. The dataset comprises 200 records with 11 attributes. To store our housing data, we have opted for MySQL relational database management system.
